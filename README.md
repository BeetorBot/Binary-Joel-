I can't play piano to save my life so I wanted to create a robot that plays piano for me. 
This will be my first full scale coding project ever. 
It took a while and there were a couple of hurdles however I was able to make it work.

Using my Schematice make all the connections.

Copy and Paste my code to your arduino.
It will proceed to play the beginning of furelise.
If you want to it play other songs you can use my website
https://beetorbot.github.io/Piano/
This will record the notes you play to an array.
Once you finish playing the song in the website click finish.
It will download the array to your computer.
Copy and paste that array to the arduino code in the
int Notes[]={ Paste Here }; 
array.
Then upload and enjoy.
